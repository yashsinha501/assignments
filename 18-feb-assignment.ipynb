    "# An API is a communication interface that allows two separate software components to share data. An API operates as a bridge\n",
    "# between internal and external software operations, allowing for a fluid interchange of data that frequently passes undetected\n",
    "# by the end-user. Simply said, an API acts as a virtual middleman, transferring data from one interface, such as a mobile app,\n",
    "# to another. APIs connect various sections of a software platform to guarantee that information is sent correctly. These \n",
    "# connection points serve as an internal communication route, and a way for external tools to access the same data. As a result,\n",
    "# APIs may be classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Private APIs: A private API is only available to developers and users within a company. These APIs are often used to link \n",
    "# internal team operations to remove silos and streamline communication.\n",
    "# Open APIs: On the other hand, open APIs allow third-party developers to quickly access and merge data from one tool to\n",
    "# another. An open or public API saves time for developers by allowing them to link their platform with already existing tools,\n",
    "# minimizing the need to construct new services.\n",
    "\n",
    "# FOR EXAMPLE =>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Have you ever used PayPal to purchase directly from an eCommerce store? That, too, is an API at work. The \"Pay with PayPal\" \n",
    "# functionality, like checking in with a social networking site, is done via APIs to ensure that the end application can only\n",
    "# do what it needs to accomplish without being exposed to sensitive data or gaining access to unwelcome privileges.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The inner workings of this useful feature are fairly similar to the login procedure discussed above. When a user selects the\n",
    "# \"Pay with PayPal\" button, the application makes an \"order\" request to the PayPal API, containing the amount owing and other\n",
    "# critical information. The user is then authenticated, and their purchase is confirmed through a pop-up. Finally, the API \n",
    "# returns payment confirmation to the application if everything goes as planned.\n"

    "# 1. REST Architecture: REST is a client-server architectural style that utilizes HTTP\n",
    "# requests to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data. RESTful web services make use of\n",
    "# standard web protocols and can be accessed using any programming language. REST\n",
    "# uses a URL structure to identify resources, and it represents each resource using JSON\n",
    "# or XML. It is lightweight, easy to implement, and scalable, making it a popular choice\n",
    "# for mobile and web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. SOAP Architecture: SOAP is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the\n",
    "# implementation of web services. SOAP messages are exchanged between client and\n",
    "# server in XML format. It relies heavily on XML for message formatting, and WSDL for\n",
    "# service description, making it more structured and more secure than REST. SOAP\n",
    "# services provide a standard way of accessing web services, making them a popular\n",

    "# Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",

    "# 1. Complexity: SOAP has a more complex structure than REST, making it more difficult\n",
    "# to implement and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Overhead: Because SOAP messages are larger than REST messages due to their XML\n",
    "# formatting, they require more bandwidth and processing power.\n",

    "# 3. Performance: The complexity and size of SOAP messages can affect the performance\n",
    "# of web services, especially for high-volume transactions.\n",

    "# the information necessary to complete the request. SOAP, on the other hand, can\n",
    "# maintain state between requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Methods: REST uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform\n",

    "# 5. Complexity: SOAP is more complex than REST and requires a lot of XML parsing. REST,\n",
    "# on the other hand, is simpler and easier to use.\n",

    "# does not have built-in support for caching.\n",
