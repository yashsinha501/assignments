    "# In Python, an exception is an error that occurs while a program is running. When an exception is encountered, the program\n",

    "# The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors in Python is that exceptions occur during runtime when a particular \n",
    "# statement or function call cannot be executed, whereas syntax errors occur during the parsing of the Python code, and they \n",
    "# are detected by the Python interpreter before the program is executed. Syntax errors are usually caused by incorrect use of \n",
