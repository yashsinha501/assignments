    "# ANS 6 =>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Be specific in handling exceptions: Catch only the exceptions that you are expecting and handle them appropriately.\n",
    "    This will make the code more robust and less prone to unexpected errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Use finally clause: When writing exception-handling code, use a finally clause to ensure that any resources that were acquired \n",
    "    are properly released. This is particularly important for operations that involve files or network connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Keep error messages concise: When raising exceptions or logging errors, keep the error messages as concise as possible. Include\n",
    "    only the relevant information that will help the user or developer understand what went wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Use built-in exceptions when possible: Python has many built-in exception classes that are specific to certain types of errors.\n",
    "    Use these exceptions whenever possible, as they provide a clear and standardized way to handle common errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Document exception handling code: Document your exception-handling code so that other developers who may work on the code later\n",
    "    can understand what is happening and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Don't swallow exceptions: Don't catch exceptions and then simply log an error message or ignore the exception. Instead, handle \n",
    "    the exception appropriately and gracefully, and let the user or developer know what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Use try-except-else: Use the try-except-else construct to separate the code that could raise an exception from the code that\n",
    "    executes when no exception is raised. This can make the code more readable and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Use logging to report errors: Use the Python logging module to report errors and debug information. This can be a more flexible\n",
    "and powerful alternative to using print statements."
