Ans 1 => Guido van Rossum
Ans 2 => Python is a high-level object-oriented programming language. 
         It has built-in data structures, combined with dynamic binding and typing, which makes it an ideal choice for rapid application development. 
         Python also offers support for modules and packages, which allows system modularity and code reuse.
Ans 3 => Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too
Ans 4 => .py
Ans 5 => Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine
Ans 6 => Indentation is used to define a block of code in python
Ans 7 => # character
Ans 8 => python_version()
Ans 9 => lambda function
Ans 10 => Preferred installer program
Ans 11 => len(),list(),abs(),object(),round(),reversed()
Ans 12 => 79 characters 
Ans 13 => Data science.
          Scientific and mathematical computing.
          Web development.
          Finance and trading.
          System automation and administration.
          Computer graphics.
          Basic game development.
          Security and penetration testing.
Ans 14 => Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.
Ans 15 => Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.
          * Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.
          * Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.
          * In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.
          * Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.
Ans 16 => Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. 
          Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
