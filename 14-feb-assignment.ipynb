    "# Multithreading is a technique of concurrent programming where multiple threads (lightweight processes) run concurrently within the same process. Multithreading has several advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages:\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 1) Improved performance: Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to execute multiple threads in\n",
    "#     parallel. This can result in faster execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Efficient use of resources: Multithreading allows a program to make efficient use of system resources like CPUs and memory by \n",
    "#     dividing the workload into smaller, more manageable chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) Improved user experience: Multithreading can improve the user experience of a program by allowing it to be more responsive to \n",
    "#     user input. For example, a multithreaded program can continue to respond to user input even while performing a long-running \n",
    "#     operation in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) Simplified programming: Multithreading can simplify the programming of complex applications by allowing different parts of the \n",
    "#     program to run concurrently, making it easier to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1) Complexity: Multithreading can introduce complexity into a program by requiring the programmer to manage concurrency issues such\n",
    "#     as synchronization, deadlock, and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Increased memory usage: Multithreading can increase the memory usage of a program since each thread requires its own stack and\n",
    "#     data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) Debugging complexity: Debugging multithreaded programs can be more complex than debugging single-threaded programs since there\n",
    "#     are multiple threads running simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4)System overhead: Multithreading can introduce additional system overhead since the operating system must manage the scheduling \n",
    "#     and execution of multiple threads."
